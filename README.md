# Calculating your interstellar age

#### By _**JButch-99**_

#### _A project meant to take your age and see how long the difference between two ages are in different orbits._

## Technologies Used:

* babel
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Node Modules
* eslintRC

## Description
_This project is meant to help you see how long it'd take, or how long ago, to reach certain years on different planets. For example, on Earth: It'd take 10 years to go from 10 to 20. However, on Mercury it'd take roughly 41.67 Mercury years to reach roughly the same age. This project includes an interactive list of planets. The choices are limited, only 5 planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter). You can also give your name in the form for a more personalized experience. This is not required. Overall, just a simple project that answers some curious questions a person may hold._
